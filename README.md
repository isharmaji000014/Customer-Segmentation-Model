# 🧠 Customer Segmentation Using Machine Learning

This project applies unsupervised learning techniques to segment customers based on purchasing behavior and demographics. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups to enable targeted marketing strategies.

## 📌 Objective

- Understand customer behavior through clustering
- Create actionable segments for business insights

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn (KMeans, PCA)
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- t-SNE for visualization

## 📁 Dataset

- `Customers.csv`: Contains customer attributes such as Age, Annual Income, Spending Score, etc.

## 🔍 Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values
   - Normalize features using `StandardScaler`
   - Encode categorical variables with `LabelEncoder` (if any)

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Visualize distributions and correlations
   - Use pairplots and heatmaps to understand feature relationships

3. **Dimensionality Reduction**
   - Apply PCA or t-SNE for visualization

4. **Clustering**
   - Use the Elbow Method to determine optimal `k`
   - Apply KMeans clustering
   - Visualize clusters in 2D space

5. **Interpretation**
   - Analyze cluster characteristics
   - Label segments (e.g., “High Spenders”, “Budget Shoppers”)

## 📊 Sample Output

- Clustered scatterplots
- Summary statistics per segment
- Business recommendations

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repo
