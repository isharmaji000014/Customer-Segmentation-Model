🧠 Customer Segmentation using Machine Learning
This project focuses on segmenting customers into distinct groups based on their behaviors and characteristics using machine learning techniques. The goal is to help businesses understand their customers better and tailor marketing strategies to different segments for improved engagement and sales.


🔍 Problem Statement
Businesses often deal with large, diverse customer bases. Understanding their customers’ purchasing patterns, demographics, or preferences can allow for personalized marketing. This project solves that by using clustering and regression techniques to categorize and predict customer behavior.


🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python (primary language)
- NumPy for numerical computations
- Pandas for data manipulation and analysis
- Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization
- Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms

  
🧪 Methodology
- Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, encoded categorical data, and normalized the features.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized key trends and relationships among variables using plots.
- K-Means Clustering: Used to divide customers into distinct groups based on features such as age, income, and spending score.
- Regression Analysis: Applied linear regression to predict numeric outcomes like annual income or spending habits.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluated clustering using metrics like silhouette score and regression using RMSE or R² score.


📈 Outcomes
- Identified key customer clusters such as high-value customers, low-engagement users, and potential churners.
- Provided insights that could help businesses design personalized loyalty programs or targeted ads.
